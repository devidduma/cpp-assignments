Reinforcement learning is a field of machine learning that is concerned about the following problem: how to make a learning agent, which might be a robot or a computer achieve or exceed human level proficiency in a given task. In a reinforcement learning problem there is always a learning agent and an environment with which the agent interacts. Beyond the agent and the environment, one can identify three main elements of a reinforcement learning system: a policy, a reward signal and a value function.
